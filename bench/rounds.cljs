  "What a table root costs, against what today's path costs, for the same answer.

  The unit is **requests**, not bytes and not wall-clock. On the hosts this
  stack ships to — a Worker ranging an object store, a browser ranging a
  bucket — a request is a round trip and bytes are nearly free by comparison;
  and this workstation runs many agents at once, so a timing number here
  would measure the load average. `kotobase-storage-pack` reports the same
  pair for the same reason.

  Both sides compute the answer and the answers are compared. A plan that
  fetched less and answered differently is not a faster plan."
