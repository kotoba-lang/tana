  "The claim this repo exists for, checked against a real Parquet reader.

  A table root is only useful if the range it recorded is **the range the
  reader would have asked for**. If it is not, the plan fetches bytes that
  parse as a different page — a failure that does not look like a failure,
  because a page header is valid wherever a varint happens to land.

  So the check is not `range looks plausible`; it is: read the column through
  `parquet.source` with a source that records every range it was asked for,
  and require the recorded read to be exactly what `tana.member` wrote down
  without opening anything."
