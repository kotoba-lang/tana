  "Sharding changes what a query costs. It must not change what it fetches.

  `tana.shard` exists because a flat root is O(members × chunks × columns)
  bytes. That is a cost argument, and cost arguments are where correctness
  quietly goes: a two-level prune that rules out a manifest whose chunks the
  flat plan would have read returns fewer rows and no error.

  So the invariant is checked over generated tables rather than argued:
  **plan(root) and plan(merge(fetched manifests)) name the same ranges.**
  Deterministic pseudo-randomness, so a failure is reproducible from the seed
  printed with it."
