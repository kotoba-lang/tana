  "The second format, which is the point.

  `columnar` proved its seam was not Parquet-shaped by plugging in a format
  whose metadata is FlatBuffers rather than Thrift and which records **no**
  column statistics. A table root that only worked over Parquet would have
  the same untested claim, so the same format asks the same question one
  level up — and the answer has to be that the root reports less, not that it
  grows a special case."
