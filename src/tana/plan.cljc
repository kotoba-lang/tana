(ns tana.plan
  "Predicate in, byte ranges out — without opening an object.

  `columnar.plan` answers *which chunks of this file* and reads them.
  This answers *which bytes of which objects*, and reads nothing: the caller
  is handed ranges and fetches them however its host fetches (an S3 GET with
  a `Range` header, an R2 binding, a CARv2 frame, a browser `fetch`).

  ## The pruning rule is borrowed, never copied

  `columnar.stats/skip?` decides. It is required here rather than
  reimplemented, because a second copy of a pruning rule drifts in the worst
  direction: fetching too few ranges throws (loud), while pruning by a stale
  copy of the rule reads chunks the real planner would have skipped and
  **returns the correct answer** — the bug is invisible in every result and
  visible only in the bill. `net-kotobase/lake` states the same rule for the
  trampoline, and this is the same seam one level up.

  ## Three outcomes per chunk, and they must stay distinguishable

  - **pruned** — statistics proved no row can match.
  - **read** — statistics could not rule it out.
  - **undecidable** — the chunk records no bounds for a predicate column, so
    it is read. This is *not* a prune and must never be counted as one: a
    planner that reports `0 read` because it could not decide anything looks
    exactly like a planner that pruned everything.

  ## Pruning decides what to read, never what matches

  Bounds may be wider than the data. Every fetched chunk still has the
  predicate applied exactly, by whatever engine decodes it. This plan is a
  fetch list, not an answer."
