(ns tana.member
  "One member of a table: an object, and everything its footer said.

  A member is the unit a table prunes at the coarse level, and it is recorded
  as **what the footer said, plus where the bytes are** — statistics and byte
  ranges together. That pairing is the whole point: a planner that holds
  statistics but not ranges must still open the object to find out where a
  column chunk begins, which is the round trip the table exists to remove.

  ## This namespace takes footers as data, not as a library

  `from-parquet-footer` accepts the map `parquet.footer/parse` returns. It
  does not require the Parquet library, and must not: a table is not a
  Parquet thing, and a dependency here would land in every consumer of the
  table plane. The same is true of Arrow, ORC and anything else — a format
  adapter is a pure function from that format's metadata to this shape.

  ## Absence is recorded as absence

  A column chunk whose writer recorded no bounds is stored with `:stats`
  present and `:min`/`:max` missing. It is never stored as an empty map, and
  never as a wide-open interval: `columnar.stats` reads a missing bound as
  *no claim*, and a fabricated one would be a claim that permits a skip."

  `:stats` carries `:rows` always, and `:min`/`:max` only when the file
  recorded them. `:codec` travels because a planner can then refuse an
  unreadable chunk *before* fetching it — a refusal that costs a download is
  a refusal that arrived too late.

  `:type` and `:def-level` travel for a sharper reason: **without them the
  saving evaporates.** A reader that holds a chunk's bytes but not its
  physical type has to fetch the footer to learn it, which is the round trip
  the root was built to remove. They are two small integers and they are what
  makes a chunk decodable on its own."

  **Arrow records no column bounds.** Not a gap in this adapter and not
  something to paper over: a member built from Arrow reports `:rows` and
  `:nulls` and no `:min`/`:max`, so `columnar.stats` refuses to prune it and
  the root gives location without pruning. A format that records less plugs
  in by reporting less. Inventing a wide-open interval here would be a claim
  the data never made, and it would permit a skip.
