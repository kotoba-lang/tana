(ns tana.table
  "A table root: one immutable value that says which bytes a query needs.

  Below this, `columnar` reads one object well and `columnar.stats` decides
  whether a chunk can be skipped. What neither can do is answer *which of a
  thousand objects to open*, because that answer lives in a thousand footers
  and reading them is the cost being avoided. A table root is those footers,
  already read, in one addressable value.

  ## What makes it a root and not a directory listing

  Three things, and dropping any one of them turns it back into a listing:

  1. **It carries the statistics**, so a predicate prunes members before any
     object is opened.
  2. **It carries byte ranges**, so a surviving chunk is one ranged GET —
     not a footer fetch followed by a chunk fetch.
  3. **It is content-addressed**, so a reader that pins a root digest is
     reading one snapshot and cannot observe a half-published table.

  ## Snapshots name their members explicitly

  A snapshot is a vector of members, not a prefix or a time. There is no
  clock to ask and a datom carries no time (`kotobase.lake.table` states the
  same rule for the datom-plane manifest, and this is that rule at the
  self-describing plane). Appending an object writes a new root naming the
  old members plus the new one; the old root keeps answering what it
  answered.

  ## `:bounds-authority` has no default, and that is the safety property

  Statistics read out of the object at query time are as trustworthy as the
  object. Statistics read out of a root are as trustworthy as **whoever
  wrote the root** — and the failure is not symmetric. Bounds that are too
  wide cost an unnecessary read; bounds that are too narrow **delete rows
  from the answer**, silently, with no error and no way for the reader to
  notice.

  So a root must declare where its bounds came from:

  | value | meaning |
  |---|---|
  | `:from-footers` | extracted from the objects' own metadata by the publisher |
  | `:declared` | asserted by a writer; not read out of the bytes |

  and `tana.plan/plan` requires the caller to say which of those it will
  trust. Neither is a default. This is the discipline `kotobase-storage`
  applies to ref profiles for the same reason: **guessing is silent**, and an
  ignored precondition returns success."
