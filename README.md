# tana

**棚 — the shelf that says which box, so you open one.**

`tana` is the table plane between a set of columnar objects and a query: a
content-addressed root that carries what every object's footer said **and
where every column chunk is**, so a predicate becomes byte ranges without
opening anything.

```clojure
(require '[tana.member :as member] '[tana.table :as table] '[tana.plan :as plan])

;; Build once, at publish time: a footer, as data.
(def m (member/from-parquet-footer {:object cid :size n} (parquet.footer/parse bytes)))

(def root (table/table {:table "prices" :columns ["price"]
                        :bounds-authority :from-footers :members [m ...]}))

;; Query time: no object is opened.
(plan/plan root {:columns ["price"] :predicates [[:= "price" 104]]
                 :trust :from-footers})
;; => {:fetch [{:object "obj:mid" :range [51 98] :covers [...]}]
;;     :rounds 2 :bytes 47
;;     :chunks {:total 9 :pruned 8 :read 1 :undecidable 0}
;;     :pruning :enabled}
```

## What it is for

CARv2 answers *where a block is*. Parquet and Arrow answer *how a table is
encoded*. Neither answers the question a lake query actually asks:

> which of these thousand objects do I have to read?

Today that answer lives in a thousand footers, and reading them is the cost.
`net-kotobase/lake` measures four round trips for **one** 2.4 KB object —
leading magic, the 8-byte tail, the footer, then the column chunk — and three
of those four are metadata. Multiply by the objects a partitioned table has
and the metadata dominates the answer.

A table root is those footers, already read, in one addressable value.

## Measured

`npm run bench:rounds` — a table of N objects × 300 rows × 3 row groups with
disjoint ranges, `price = k`, both paths computing the answer and the answers
compared. Requests, because on a Worker or a browser a request is a round
trip and bytes are cheap by comparison.

| objects | baseline requests | sharded requests | baseline bytes | sharded bytes |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | 4 | 3 | 1,108 | 1,789 |
| 10 | 31 | 3 | 3,637 | 7,971 |
| 50 | 151 | 3 | 14,877 | 23,325 |
| 200 | 601 | 3 | 57,027 | 24,143 |
| **1,000** | **3,001** | **3** | **281,827** | **26,891** |

Requests go flat. **Bytes do not, and the flat root is a trap:** it is
O(members × chunks × columns), about 700 bytes per member here, so at 1,000
objects a single root is 699 KB — worse than reading every footer. That is
what `tana.shard` is for, and the crossover is why it exists rather than
being an optimisation for later. Below ~30 objects the root costs more bytes
than it saves; the table above prints both numbers so the crossover is
visible rather than argued.

## Aggregates cost one request and read nothing

```clojure
(require '[tana.aggregate :as agg])
(agg/aggregate root {:agg :max :column "price" :trust :from-footers})
;; => {:value 999299 :from :statistics :read 0 :requests 1}
```

Parquet already answers `max` from a footer with `:read 0`, so the baseline
reads no column data either — what it cannot avoid is **opening every object
to reach those footers**. Measured, same bench:

| objects | baseline requests | tana requests |
|---:|---:|---:|
| 200 | 600 | **1** |
| 1,000 | 3,000 | **1** |

Every guard `columnar.aggregate` documents applies one level up, plus one
that only exists here: **`:location-only` trust refuses.** When pruning, a
wrong bound costs a read; in an aggregate the bound **is** the answer. A
refusal returns `{:from :refused :reason ...}` and never a value with a quiet
caveat — "could not" and "the answer is nothing" must not share a shape.

## Arrow is the second format, and it plugs in by reporting less

`member/from-arrow` takes what `arrow.ipc` returned, as data. **Arrow records
no column bounds**, so a root over Arrow gives location and prunes nothing:

```clojure
(plan/plan root {:columns ["price"] :predicates [[:= "price" 104]] :trust :from-footers})
;; {:chunks {:total 3 :pruned 0 :read 3 :undecidable 3}}
(agg/aggregate root {:agg :count :trust :from-footers})        ; {:value 9 :read 0}
(agg/aggregate root {:agg :max :column "price" :trust :from-footers})
;; {:from :refused :reason :bounds-not-recorded}
```

`count` still answers from metadata, because row counts are not bounds. `max`
is refused **by name** rather than invented. A mixed table prunes its Parquet
members and reads its Arrow ones — absence in one member does not disable
pruning for the others, and there is a test that requires exactly that.

This is the same question `columnar` asked itself when it acquired a second
format: a seam with a sample size of one is an untested claim.

## Three things it records, and dropping any one loses the saving

| recorded | without it |
|---|---|
| statistics (`:min` `:max` `:rows`) | nothing prunes; every object is opened |
| byte range `[start end)` | you know *which* object, not *which bytes* — the footer fetch comes back |
| `:type` `:codec` `:def-level` `:data-at` | the chunk's bytes are not decodable alone — the footer fetch comes back |

The third row is the one that is easy to miss. `tana.chunk-only-test` decodes
a planned range with `parquet.decode` directly and no footer at any point,
because a plan that still needs a footer saved one request and spent three.

## `:bounds-authority` and `:trust` have no defaults

Statistics read out of an object at query time are as trustworthy as the
object. Statistics read out of a root are as trustworthy as **whoever wrote
the root**, and the failure is not symmetric:

- bounds **too wide** → an unnecessary read. A cost.
- bounds **too narrow** → rows are deleted from the answer. Silent, with no
  error, and indistinguishable from a table that simply had no such rows.

So a root declares `:from-footers` or `:declared`, a plan declares what it
will trust, and neither has a default. `:location-only` is the honest third
option: use the root to find bytes, prune nothing. `kotobase-storage` refuses
a backend that declares no ref profile for the same reason — **guessing is
silent, and an ignored precondition returns success.**

## The pruning rule is borrowed, never copied

`columnar.stats/skip?` decides, at both levels — chunks in `tana.plan`, and
manifests in `tana.shard`, which presents manifest bounds in the same shape.
A second copy of a pruning rule drifts in the worst direction: under-fetching
throws (loud), while pruning by a stale copy reads chunks the real planner
would have skipped and **still returns the correct answer**. The bug is
invisible in every result and visible only in the bill.

Two rules are inherited with it and are load-bearing here:

- **Absent statistics never permit a skip.** A chunk with no bounds is read,
  and counted as `:undecidable` — never as `:pruned`. A planner reporting
  `0 read` because it could not decide anything looks exactly like one that
  pruned everything.
- **Pruning decides what to read, never what matches.** Bounds may be wider
  than the data; every fetched chunk still has the predicate applied exactly.

`tana.shard` extends the first upward: a manifest reports bounds for a column
only when **every** chunk under it reported them. Deriving a bound from the
chunks that did report invents a claim the data never made.

## Sharding changes what a query costs, never what it fetches

That is a correctness claim, and cost arguments are where correctness quietly
goes: a two-level prune that rules out a manifest whose chunks the flat plan
would have read returns fewer rows and no error. So it is checked over
generated tables — overlapping ranges, unbounded chunks, 40 seeds × 4 shard
sizes × 4 predicates — rather than argued:

    plan(root)  ==  plan(merge(manifests the top could not rule out))

by the exact set of `(object, range)` pairs. A second test requires the shard
layer to actually rule things out (8 disjoint members, 1 manifest fetched),
because the invariant above would also hold for a layer that pruned nothing —
proving a tautology is the failure mode of an invariant test.

`aggregate-top` answers `count`, `min` and `max` from the top alone, and is
checked to agree with `aggregate` over the whole root on the same tables:
either both answer with the same value or **both refuse**. A top that
answered where the root refused would be folding bounds the data never
reported. It refuses `count-non-null` by name — the top does not carry null
counts, and answering with `count` would be wrong by exactly the nulls.

## Two levels, and why they are content-addressed

```text
top          one small object: per-manifest bounds
 └─ manifest per-member statistics and byte ranges
      └─ object   the Parquet / Arrow file itself
```

Iceberg's manifest-list/manifest split has this shape, from the same
pressure. What differs is that every level here is content-addressed, so a
reader pins one address and **cannot observe a half-published table** — there
is no catalog service holding a mutable pointer to the current snapshot, and
a snapshot names its members explicitly rather than being "whatever existed
at time T".

`tana.plan/select-manifests` is pure: it returns the addresses to fetch and
the caller fetches them. Keeping IO out is what lets the same planner run in
a Worker, a browser and a JVM test.

## What it is not

- **Not a file format.** Chunks stay Parquet or Arrow. Inventing a columnar
  encoding here would be re-inventing a small Parquet, badly.
- **Not a container.** Where an object lives — one object per CID, or a
  CARv2 pack with an offset — is `kotobase-storage`'s question. A range from
  this planner composes with a pack's range; it does not replace it.
- **Not a catalog.** `kotobase-lake` records what landed and who claimed
  what, on the datom plane, and answers that with Datalog. This answers one
  narrower question from one self-describing value, which is what a browser
  holding a bucket URL can use.
- **Not a query engine.** `columnar` decodes and filters. This hands it less
  to decode.

## Runtimes

`clojure -M:test` and `npm run test:nbb` — **36 tests, 1,093 assertions**,
both green, and green on a real fleet node (`test-tana-7394fea-murakumo-levi`,
receipt `76d8591167ea`). Portable `.cljc`, one runtime dependency.

The suite has been shown red on **eight** real defects and green again with
each reverted:

| broken | failures |
|---|---:|
| absent statistics permit a skip | 2 |
| `:trust` defaults instead of being required | 1 |
| a chunk range one byte too long | 1 |
| a predicate no longer disqualifies an aggregate fold | 1 |
| `:location-only` trust answers an aggregate anyway | 4 |
| the Arrow adapter invents wide-open bounds | 4 |
| manifest bounds derived from only the chunks that reported | **581** |
| the top answers `count-non-null` with `count` | 1 |

A gate that has only ever been green is a gate nobody has asked a question.

## Known, and not papered over

- **The datom-plane manifest cannot produce a root on its own.**
  `kotobase.lake.table` records object, rows, partition values and per-column
  statistics — and **no byte ranges**. So a bridge from it still costs one
  footer read per member. Recorded here rather than filed as done: the two
  manifests overlap in statistics and differ in exactly the field that makes
  the round trip go away.
- **`aggregate-top` does not fall back to the manifests.** A column no
  manifest bounds is refused rather than resolved by fetching them; a caller
  that wants that fetches and calls `aggregate` on the merged root, which is
  one more request and its own decision.
- **Packs are orthogonal, deliberately.** ADR-2608160100 keeps columnar
  objects out of CARv2 packs (they are large objects with footer range reads,
  and wrapping a multi-MB column in a CAR frame doubles the indirection). A
  range from this planner composes with a pack's range; nothing here assumes
  either layout.
